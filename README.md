# Project Portfolio Web App

This repository is the starting point for developing a web application to showcase project portfolios.

## Current Status: Hello World!

Currently, the project consists of a simple "Hello World" page (`index.html`). This serves as the initial setup and a placeholder for future development.

The `index.html` page is intended to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Long-Term Vision

The long-term goal is to build a dynamic and visually appealing web application where various project portfolios can be displayed. This will include features such as:
- Project descriptions
- Image/video galleries
- Links to live demos and source code
- Categorization and filtering of projects

Stay tuned for updates!
